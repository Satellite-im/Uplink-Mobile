# Packages

The Uplink app is built with a modular architecture. The **packages** folder contains two packages that are used to build the app.

- ### UI Library
    [UI Library](ui_library/usage.md) is a package that includes reusable components, like widgets, constants, fonts, icons, placeholders, etc. It is for building the user interfaces in the Uplink app.
- ### UI Showroom
    [UI Showroom](ui_showroom/usage.md) is a package that includes all the example screens to show all the components of the UI Library. This package is for demonstration purposes only, **do not use it in the production environment**.
